		<h2 class="border">Reddit</h2>
		<img src="./images/reddit.png">
		<p>Reddit makes it easy for people to receive information and interact with a community within their set of interests.<br><br>
		The biggest visual challenges for this site are making it easy to navigate and interact with, and making it look good without shifting focus away from the content.
		Since there is so much content on reddit, the site has to be organized so that first-time users aren't overwhelmed with options. The page shown is reddit's front page. It's the site's landing page, and contains the most popular posts across all subreddits.</p>
		<img src="./images/reddit-wf.png">
		<p>Looking at the wireframe, there appears to be four sections, aside from the logo. At the top are a list of popular subreddits. Directly below that are a list of content sorting options. Below that are a list of posts, each one having a voting sidebar, picture, title, and subreddit name. Lastly, to the right is a section dedicated to search, uploading, and donation.<br><br>
		The site is nicely divided into two parts, a passive part and an active part. The passive part is for finding popular content (top nav bar), browsing content, and sorting content. The active part (box on the right), contains all the possible ways that you can interact with the site. There's the search bar, log-in forms, and links for content submission and donation to the site.<br><br>
		The visual aesthetic of the site is sorta dry and monday-morning-office feeling. Though, the focus of the site is on the content (pictures + descriptions), so it's probably best to have a layout which doesn't distract from that.</p>

		<h2 class="border">Soundcloud</h2>
		<img src="./images/soundcloud.png">
		<p>Soundcloud is an audio sharing platform which makes it easy for people to discover artists, share music, store music, and listen to music nearly anywhere. It is free and there are no advertisements. The page shown is a user profile page.<br><br>
		The biggest visual challenge for this site is organizing it in a way which makes it clear to the user what their options are for finding music, and what they can do with the music. Another challenge is keeping the playback portion of the site independent from the browsing portion of the site, so that the user can do both at the same time without hassle/interruption.</p>
		<img src="./images/soundcloud-wf.png">
		<p>Looking at the wireframe, there appears to be two main sections. At the top, there is a menu with every possible option for finding music and a series of tabs regarding your account, messaging, and uploading. The other section of the page is dedicated to your profile and its content. There is a submenu which links to different features of your profile, like your followers, playlists, likes, comments, etc. Below that is a list of content corresponding to the selected submenu tab. Each audio track contains an image, title, and search tag. Below the track are options for commenting, liking, sharing, and storing.<br><br>
		The site is nicely discretized into two parts. One part is dedicated to audio playback and social networking and the other is dedicated to searching/browsing and more administrative sort of things. The site also does a great job at separating both of these parts. One can search and browse for music and navigate through different parts of the site without interrupting audio playback. Also, the navigation menu at the top is present on every page.</p>

		
		<h2 class="border">Sparkfun</h2>
		<img src="./images/sparkfun.png">
		<p>Sparkfun makes hardware hacking accessible through excellent open-source documentation, support communities, tutorials, product reviews, and products for hackers of different background levels.<br><br>
		Sparkfun offers a lot. They have tons of products, and many other features beyond their store. Like with the other sites, their biggest challenge is making it easy for folx to see exactly what the site has to offer, and to be able to find the things they need. This needs to be made as simple as possible, since the site is catering towards people of all different skill levels -- including total novices. The page shown above is an example product page.</p>
		<img src="./images/sparkfun-wf.png">
		<p>Looking at the wireframe, there appears to be three main sections ordered sequentially from left to right. On the left, there's a wonderful sidebar that categorizes every product Sparkfun has to offer into menus and submenus. They are arranged alphabetically -- which is very helpful. At the top of the menu is a tab titled "start a project." This tab contains lists of possible project ideas and tutorials, which are helpful for novices who don't even know how to begin a project or what they need to do so.<br><br>

		The second section is the product page. It contains all the information someone would need about the product. For each product there are multiple images, a title, part number, description, features, and a list of datasheets, source documents, and tutorials associated with the product. Below that are comments + recommended products.<br><br>

		The last section, on the left, is dedicated to purchasing. There's multiple pricing options for different quantities purchased, and an add to wish list option. Below that is a little "skills" tab, with icons that describe pictorially the skills and skill levels required to use/assemble the product.<br><br>

		This is sort of a great way to organize a website I think. The site is ordered left to right sequentially, the same way that we'd read a book. On the left, the user finds the product that they want. In the middle, the user examines the product and what others think about the product. Finally, on the right, the user purchases the product. But before they do so, they are reminded of what skills they will need to use/assemble the product.</p>
