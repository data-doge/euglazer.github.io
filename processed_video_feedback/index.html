      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        When a video camera is pointed at a screen displaying its own output, something curious happens. A feedback loop of images, infinitely repeating onto and over themselves, is generated. This phenomena is called video feedback, and it's pretty fun to play around with.
      </p>

      <p>
        We've taken this phenomena, and added a bit of video processing wizardry and human interactivity to it. By substituting a traditional monitor with a projector, we've made it possible for folks to physically be a part of the video feedback loop, by simply stepping in front of the projected image. We've also been playing with several video processing algorithms to programmatically manipulate the captured video during projection. The results are so good!

      <p>
        Here's an example of what can be observed:

      <p>
        In the above example, the video camera's image is programmatically scaled and rotated during projection, creating a beautiful, fractalesque pattern of colors and shapes.

        Here are a couple more examples:

      <p>
        In the above example ... background subtraction ... red circles ... video feedback

      <h2>Materials and Setup</h2>
      <p>
        Our setup is relatively easy to reproduce. All we need is a projector, video camera, and a raspberry pi. The raspberry pi will be connected to the video camera and projector, and will continously run our video processing algorithms, cycling from one to the next (maybe every few minutes or so). Simple and low risk.
