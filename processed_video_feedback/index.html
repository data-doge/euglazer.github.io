        When a video camera is pointed at a screen displaying its own output, something curious happens . . . 
      </p>

      <p class="project-description">
         A feedback loop of images, infinitely repeating onto and over themselves, is generated. The result is a beautiful combination of fractal-like images and video, immediately interactive, and rooted in the wonder and awe in the universe around us. We've taken this idea and added video processing wizardry and human interactivity to it.
      </p>

      <p>
        By substituting a traditional monitor with a projector, we allow anyone to physically be a part of the video feedback loop, by simply stepping in front of the projected image. We've also been playing with several video processing algorithms to programmatically manipulate the captured video during projection. The results are impressive!
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's an example of what can be observed:
      </p>

      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KGh2OP2ayx8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

      <p>
        In the above example, the video camera's image is programmatically scaled and rotated during projection, creating a beautiful, fractalesque pattern of colors and shapes.
      </p>
       
      <p>
        Here are a couple more examples:
      </p>

      <p>
        In the above examples, we run the webcam feed through a background subtraction algorithm in order to detect movement of users in the space. We paint detected changes as pure white and draw a red circle around changed pixels. The detected movement changes the visuals of the projection, which feeds back into the webcam as further movement, creating intense flashes of brightness as a small change blows up into a large one, and then slowly fades back towards the center.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some final examples ... 
      </p>

      <p>
        The best part about the piece is that you can physically be a part of the installation, interacting with it by simply standing in front of the wall. Your presence blends into the rest of the image and adds its own unique mix of color and shape into the resulting image.

      <h2>Materials and Setup</h2>
      <p>
        Our setup is relatively easy to reproduce. All we need is a projector, webcam, and a raspberry pi. The raspberry pi will be connected to the video camera and projector, and will continously run our video processing algorithms, cycling from one to the next (maybe every few minutes or so). Simple and low risk.

      <p>This piece is easily adaptable to a wide range of spaces and sizes; its simplistic setup allows it to perform well in areas small and large. In our tests and youtube videos we have an 8-foot wide image and put the webcam about 8 feet away from the screen.

I am a creative coder and web developer in the Bay Area that is interested in how technology can teach and facilitate new types of understanding and communication. I want to show the breathtaking beauty and awe that is inherent in mathematics and physics in a simple, aesthetically pleasing way. I'm particularly interested in how modelling natural phenomena through a computer can provide insights into those processes.</p>
