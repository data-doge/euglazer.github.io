			<h2>Thinking/Learning Styles</h2>
			<p>According to <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Gregorc's criteria</a>, my personal thinking style can be best described as concrete random and abstract random. This would imply that I like to experiment, and that I organize info through reflection, and do well in unstructured, social environments.<br><br>
			So, I don't care much for tests like these. I don't like the idea of someone taking a test which explains to them how they think, what they like, how they learn best, and what is difficult for them. This is very limiting -- people may take these tests and become convinced that this is the way they think, and that this is static.<br><br>

			The individual, of course, knows what they like and how they think and what they find difficult because they are themselves. I'd hope also, that they know that their thinking style is fluid and can be adapted to their current context in whatever way is optimal.<br><br>

			My biggest struggles with Phase 0 have been the reflections. I think that because I hardly read or write, I have lost my ability to write with proper English quickly. When I explain concepts, I like to draw and use my hands and demonstrate right then and there how something works / what something does / etc. When I write, I can't do this, and so it's slower and a bit frustrating. As I blog more though, I notice that I am improving. So that's nice.</p>
