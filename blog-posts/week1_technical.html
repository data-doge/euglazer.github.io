				<h2>[09/23/14] Design + UX Evaluation</h2>
				<p>Hello meow. In this post I'll be evaluating the design + UX of three websites that I visit frequently: reddit.com, soundcloud.com, and sparkfun.com.</p>
				<section>
					<h3><a href="https://www.reddit.com" target="_blank">reddit</a></h3>
					<p>Reddit is a hub for information. Anonymous users submit content to the site and file it under a particular category (or "subreddit") where it is voted up ("upvoted") or voted down ("downvoted"). Comments on submissions can also be upvoted/downvoted. Content receiving the most upvotes rises to the top of the site. So, when you visit the front page of reddit or a subreddit, you're sort of seeing the best and newest of the internet at that particular moment. Reddit is completely free and funded through user donations. There are no corporate advertisements.<br><br> 

					The site is very simple, and sort of ugly actually. The color scheme reminds me of windows XP or something? It feels very dry, and monday morning, and like a musty office. I don't really care though, because the site is so useful to me. The site is simple to navigate. If I want to find anything, I just click on the search bar, type what I want to find, and that's it. This search bar is on every page. Everything works 99.99% of the time.<br><br>

					The site's content varies widely, depending on which subreddit you're in. Generally though, the mood is lighthearted and unfiltered. And since user's are more||less anonymous, posts are honest. The site is updated constantly, so the content can change quite a bit within only a few hours.<br><br> 

					When I look at the website, my eyes are drawn to a few things predominantly: 1) the reddit logo in the upper right corner, 2) the pictures aside the links, and 3) a little gold progress bar indicating the amount of donations received/required to keep reddit functioning. All those things are pretty important, so I suppose it's good that my eyes are drawn to them.<br><br> 

					My only complaint is that the site is too interesting. When I have a lot of shit to do, reddit is a very bad place for me to go.</p>

					<h3><a href="https://www.soundcloud.com" target="_blank">soundcloud</a></h3>
					<p>Soundcloud is a free online distribution platform where users can upload/download/share/promote/ + listen to music. Users can upload up to 2 hours of music for free, and listen to music free without limit and without advertisements.<br><br>

					The site is very easy to navigate. If you know what you're looking for, you can use the search bar at the top to find it. If you're searching for new music, you can use the explore function to find new music of a particular genre. The site allows you to search for new songs without interrupting playback of the current song you're listening to. This function is super nice.<br><br>
						
					The site looks really good. It's simple + minimalistic and looks thin, crisp, soft, + open. The color scheme is black, grey, + white with orange to highlight important parts of the page, like the logo, menu, play button, and progress bar. These are the places that my eye is drawn to when visiting the site, so that's good.<br><br>  

					The site allows you to add time-stamped comments to a song while it's playing, without interrupting playback. When you a play a song, you can see every comment on the song appearing at their respective timestamps. It's a nice feature, especially when you're trying to get the name of a song in a mix/djset.<br><br>

					Sharing/sending/saving music is also made very easy. At the bottom of each track is a little menu with buttons for the above options. You can also follow artists and receive notifications whenever they release new tracks and so on.<br><br> 

					It's a useful site, and it looks really sexy. I use it all day every day when I work.</p>

					<h3><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com" target="_blank">sparkfun</a></h3>
					<p>Sparkfun is an online electronics retailer that manufactures + sells electronics development platforms and components for makers and hardware hackers. All their products are open source and they host hundreds of free tutorials on hardware hacking + development<br><br>

					Sparkfun does a great job at making hardware-hacking accessible. Along with open-sourcing everything and offering free tutorials, the site is well-organized and easy to navigate. Products are divided into groups and subgroups and listed on a sidebar to the left. There is also a search bar with a little "suggested results" dropdown that updates while you type. The sidebar and search bar are present on every product page.<br><br>

					When browsing through their products, each one has a picture, title, price, and part number. You can choose to organize the items as a block grid, or as a vertical list. With the vertical list option, there is also a brief description of the product, and an "Add to Cart" button on the side.<br><br>

					On each product's page, along with the pictures/price/description/"add to cart"/etc. there are also a list of links to the product's open-source hardware files, software files, and a github page for the product. To the right of that is a little div with icons describing what skills + skill levels are required to assemble/use the product. Below, there are a list of recommended items to pair with the current product. Below that are comments from sparkfun members.<br><br>

					The site's color scheme is nice -- mostly white, grey, and black, with red used to highlight important items, like the current tab, product names, the "add to cart" button, the "skills" icons, and the external links to related items and source files. The products too, mostly circuit boards, are silk-screened red.<br><br>
