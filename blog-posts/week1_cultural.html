				<h2>[9-24-14] Thoughts on EDA's Culture</h2>
				<p>So, I just finished watching one of EDA's introductory video, <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Fireside Chat w/ Shereef</a>, and now I feel like I have a better idea of what EDA is and what my experience will be like. In this post I'll write about my initial impressions/feelings/expectations of EDA's culture.</p>
				<section>
					<h3>Impressions</h3>
					<p>EDA seems like it will be pretty difficult, and possibly overwhelming. At the same time, though, it seems that the teachers will be understanding and supportive. I love the emphasis on emotional intelligence, communication, and collaboration. I also like that open-source, web accessibility, and contributing to the community are a part of the curriculum. Also, it's nice to see slides/articles from skillcrush and girldevelopit. All these things, along with the fast-paced, project-based curriculum, make me feel really optimistic about EDA. It seems to be more than just learning how to code, but also how to be good to your co-workers, clients, and your community.<br><br>

					I like that Shereef brought up this idea of table v. kitchen mindset. I remember in university, the vast majority of students were just waiting to receive their education, and their grades, and their jobs, so that they can receive lots of money. Not enough people gave a shit about learning, and that felt yucky. I like that EDA is making it clear from the start that this school is only for people who genuinely want to learn and create.<br><br>

					Hmm, I guess it really depends on whoever is in the cohort, but the things that EDA is emphasizing makes me think that I will be in an environment where people are glad to help eachother and share knowledge. It also seems like a place where learning/creativity are most important, so noone is copying code, or bullshitting eachother in order to feign understanding. You know? None of that unproductive, ego-driven shit.</p>

					<h3>Goals</h3>
					<p>I love the idea of EDA, and am grateful that this sort of alternative education exists. I want to do my best to further prove EDA and other DBCs as a functional program, and so I will be trying my hardest to produce good work and be good to my cohort. V excited, meow.</p>
