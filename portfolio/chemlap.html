  <h1>Chemical Laptop</h1>

    <article>
      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>>> The Chemical Laptop, co-engineered with Los Gatos Research, is a portable, reprogammable, battery-operated, microchip capillary electrophoresis (&microCE) system designed to detect molecular signatures of life in liquid samples. Using microfluidic technology and miniaturized components, it allows for high-precision chemical analyses on microliter samples. The instrument is lightweight and battery-powered, so these analyses can be performed on site, or in the field. In short, the instrument operates as follows:<br>
      1. A liquid sample is introduced to the instrument and processed with a series of buffers, pH indicators, acids, bases, standards, and fluorescent labeling dyes. These reagents allow for on-chip sample derivatization, mixing, dilution, and pH adjustment.<br>
      2. The processed sample is then exported to a high voltage, electrophoretic micro-channel where it is separated into components differing in mass and charge.<br>
      3. As these components migrate down the channel, dye-labeled constituents are excited by a laser and detected by a UV-vis spectrometer. Excitation and fluorescence emission are filtered by a series of bandpass and dichroic filters.<br>
      4. Lastly, detection signal is visualized and processed with LabVIEW software on a tablet computer mounted atop the instrument.<br>
      >> The first prototype was completed in May 2013, about a week before my arrival. The objective of my work that summer was to test and characterize the newly developed prototype, and prepare the instrument for a completely automated, end-to-end field analysis. This required several modifications to its existing hardware and software, and the development of new hardware and software.</p>

      <h2>Project Details</h2>

      <figure class="large" >
        <img src="./chemlap/observation.png">
        <figcaption>>> The Chemical Laptop arrived at our lab with software developed by Los Gatos Research allowing for real-time observation of the spectrometer's measured signal across its entire range of detection. This meant that the signal at 3648 discrete wavelengths were being recorded every 50ms. As you can imagine, output files were enormous with memory costs of 24MB / min.<br>
        >> My redesigned interface, shown above, allows the user to truncate raw data from the spectrometer to a desired wavelength range. It also allows the user to record only the integrated signal vs time within that wavelength range. This significantly reduced memory costs, and made data analysis quite a bit easier.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure class="large">
        <img src="./chemlap/delay_time.png">
        <figcaption>>> Since our microfluidic chips are manually assembled, each chip differs in certain qualities, like fluidic resistance. Whenever a new chip is assembled, the optimum wait time between valve actuations must be characterized. Long wait times result in greater fluid transfer, but longer processing time. Conversely, short wait times result in less fluid transfer, but faster processing time. Therefore, a careful optimization was required to balance these contradictory effects.<br>
        >> A typical labeling protocol is shown on the left. To the right is a plot of volume recovery vs. wait time for each of its processes. At wait times of 500ms, sufficient volume transfers were recorded with great consistency across reservoirs and trial runs. For these reasons, a wait time of 500ms was used for future labeling protocols.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>>> Here's a video of the amino acid labeling protocol, with food coloring used to represent samples/reagents. You will see each of the steps outlined in the previous figure. In between each step is a rinse cycle to clear leftover reagents in the processing chip before the next step.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
        <img src="./chemlap/rinse1.png" class="medium">
        <figcaption>>> Between each labeling step, a rinse step is required to wash away residual chemicals. I spent quite some time designing and testing rinse cycles to determine one which required the least power, volume, and time. My results are shown in the above bubble plot. Four candidates were chosen from this bunch and examined in greater detail.</figcaption>
      </figure>

        <figcaption>>> Here's a video of the rinse cycle I eventually chose. It was a combination of the two best rinse cycles from my initial experiments. Beautiful video.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure class="large">
      <img src="./chemlap/phoutline.png">
        <figcaption>>> Since our labeling reactions were pH dependent, and since typical pH electrodes were too large, expensive, and high-maintenance for our needs, I spent a fair amount of time developing an automated method for colorimetrically determining and adjusting the pH of sample solutions containing pH indicators during processing, using a USB microscope which had initially been installed on the instrument for remote observation. After several experiments, I developed the process outlined above.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure class="large">
      <img src="./chemlap/ph_interface.jpg">
        <figcaption>>> This is my LabVIEW interface for the colorimetric pH determination software. It takes real-time video data from the USB microscope and calculates the average RGB values of a cropped region of interest. These RGB values can then be used to estimate the pH of an indicator-containing solution.<br>
        >> The program is designed to add acid or base to the sample solution until the RGB values reach an experimentally determined threshold indicative of the proper pH range for reaction.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure class="large">
      <img class="large" src="./chemlap/ph_USB.png">
        <figcaption>>> Here's a picture of a simple mounting system I designed to properly position the USB microscope for these colorimetric pH adjustment processes.</figcaption>
      </figure>


      <figure class="large">
        <img src="./chemlap/manifold3.png">
        <figcaption>>> On the hardware side of things, I spent some time exploring the feasibility of using 3D printed parts to develop a lightweight, air-tight pneumatic manifold for our microfluidic chip to rest atop. The previous manifold shipped with the instrument was also 3D printed, but over time the material started slowly deforming to a point where it wasn't usable.<br>
        >> After some research, I decided to try re-fabricating the manifold with an Objet 3D printer. These printers produced beautiful, lightweight, air-tight parts with smooth, flat surfaces; however, since the manifold had 32 internal channels, its support material proved impossible to remove.<br>
        >> Eventually, I ended up designing a three-piece aluminum manifold -- each piece clamped together with laser-cut gaskets in between. Unfortunately, I'd gone back to university before the fabricated parts had been shipped to the lab.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure class="large">
        <img src="./chemlap/cartridge1.png">
        <figcaption>>> Lastly, before heading back to university, I'd began prototyping miniature, modular, refillable cartridges for easily storing/dispensing sets of reagents to the instrument. Since each class of compound our instrument was capable of analyzing required a unique set of reagents and pH indicators, and since our instrument was designed for use in field experiments, we needed a set of analyte-specific cartridges which could be easily attached and detached from the instrument.<br>
        >> Shown above is the first iteration of these cartridges, which relied on a vacuum seal to hold the reagents in place. This didn't work so well, but it did look pretty.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure class="large">
        <img src="./chemlap/cartridge2.png">
        <figcaption>>> Here's the second iteration of those cartridges. This one contained an inner piece which fit tightly inside the cartridge. When the piece was turned to the right, it blocked all the channels containing the reagents. When turned to the left, the channels opened, dispensing the reagents to the microfluidic chip below.<br>
        >> This, too, did not work, but looked very pretty. Unfortunately, solvents with relatively low surface tension ended up leaking through the seal.</figcaption>
