  <h1>PISCES</h1>

    <article>
      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>>> The Planetary <em>In-Situ</em> Capillary Electrophoresis System (PISCES) is a portable, miniature, modular instrument designed to analyze molecular signatures of extraterrestrial life. The instrument uses microcapillary electrophoresis (&microCE) with laser-induced fluorescence detection (LIFD) to analyze fluorescently-labeled analytes prepared on a multilayer microfluidic chip.<br>
      >> PISCES is divided into three main systems:<br>
      [1] The pneumatic system is the processing core of PISCES. It contains 48 electrofluidic solenoid valves which open and close together in various sequences to induce movement of fluids through an array of interconnecting channels on one layer of the microfluidic chip. On this layer of the chip, introduced samples are processed with a set of stored reagents before separation by &microCE.<br>
      [2] The &microCE system is the analytical core of PISCES. It contains an electrophoretic channel integrated into a separate layer of the microfluidic chip. By generating a strong electric field across the fluidic medium in the channel, separation of a chemical mixture into components of differing mass and charge is achieved.<br>
      [3] The LIFD system is the detection core of PISCES. It uses an optical pathway and spectrometer to detect laser induced fluorescence of labeled analytes passing through the electrophoretic channel.<br>

      <p>>> Before my arrival, it was clear what PISCES needed to do, what parts it needed, what qualifying experiments needed to be performed, etc., but it had not yet been designed.<br>
        >> That summer, it was my job to begin designing and building the instrument. I made a fair amount of progress in the ten weeks I was there, but had to go back to university before completing the instrument. I learned a shitton while working on this project. It was my first introduction to Solidworks, LabVIEW, AutoCAD, Arduino, microfluidics, rapid prototyping, circuit design, and optics. It was very fun, and I've been hardware hacking ever since.</p>

      <h2>Project Details</h2>

      <p>>> PISCES is divided into five modules, each of which can be easily detached from the system for subsystem testing in extreme environments mimicking the desired planetary target.<br>
      >> The pneumatic module contains the pneumatics and control circuitry required to operate the 48 electrofludiic solenoid valves responsible for on chip sample processing. This includes two micropumps (air and vacuum), pumping manifolds (to interface the micropumps with the solenoid valves), a printed circuit board (to interface the control circuitry with the solenoid valves), an Arduino microcontroller (to switch the solenoid valves between states), and an h-bridge solenoid driver board (to convert the Arduino's unipolar digital output to the bipolar voltage input that the solenoids require).</p>

<!--       [3] Optical Electronics Module: contains the spectrometer, laser, and laser power supply necessary for LIFD.<br>
      [4] Optics Module: contains the optical pathway directing laser light to the chip, and fluorescent light to the spectrometer.<br>
      [5] Power Supply Module: contains batteries and circuitry required to power the above modules.<br>
 -->
      <p>The &micro module contains the circuitry required to apply between 3-15 kV to the microdevice's electrophoretic channel. This includes two 3kV HV power supplies and one 15kV power supply, and circuitry allowing control over and monitoring of the output voltage for each power supply.</p>

The Arduino MEGA was switched out for the smaller, cheaper Arduino UNO. A bipolar to unipolar converter and summing amplifier were added to every junction between the HV power supplies and analog inputs on the arduino, to prevent negative currents to the arduino.</figcaption>
