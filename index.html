		<img src="http://bit.ly/1z2vfh8"/>

		<p>I'm an artist and a hacker. I make ideas real through hard work, community, and google search. My background is in circuit design, mechanical part design, rapid fabrication, microfluidics, analytical + computational chemistry, and recently haptics + augmented reality. In my free time, I build and program electronic musical instruments and interactive art installations. I take a great interest in people -- in particular, how to inspire creativity, confidence, and empathy within them.</p>

		<p>After years of hardware development, I've decided to shift gears and start building software. I love building things, solving puzzles, and making things look pretty. Web development is just another way for me to do that, but unlike hardware, prototyping is unbelievably fast and there are no material/fabrication costs. All I need is my computer and an internet connection. This is a dream.</p>

		<p>As a web developer, I aim to make knowledge more open + easily accessible, and represent data in a way which is beautiful and informative. I'm most interested in web APIs, data visualization, and UI/UX. I'm also interested in making silly web art.</p>

				<h3>Enspiral Dev Academy</h3>
				<h4>Ruby on Rails - Weka Cohort - 2014</h4>
				<p>>> At Dev Academy, I fell in love with test-driven development, git, and web APIs. I immersed myself in both front-end and back-end development, gaining a solid hold with css, js, ruby, and rails. Having a couple years prior experience programming, I spent much of my time developing my mentoring and project management skills.</p>

				<h3>University of California, Berkeley</h3>
				<h4>Chemistry B.S. - 2014</h4>
				<p>>> Studied chemistry with an emphasis in analytical chemistry. Spent my senior year skipping nearly all my classes to hack on hardware with my friends, make music, and study electrical engineering, programming, web design, and russian. It was time wonderfully spent.</p>

				<h3>[2014] Love To Think</h3>
				<h4>Enspiral Dev Academy, Final Project</h4>
				<p>>> Love to Think is a dating site built on rails. It's an experiment, created as a response to reductive dating sites, like Tinder, that reduce an entire human down to an image. Instead, Love to Think represents users based on their doings -- the way they interact with the web and how they consume media. The app finds matches by identifying similarities in the twitter, youtube, and soundcloud activity of users on the site. The matching algorithm is still in the works, but the front-end, back-end, user management, messaging, and twitter/youtube/soundcloud api interaction portions of the site are all complete.</p>

				<h3>[2014] Audio-Tactile Backpack</h3>
				<h4>Cognitive Technology Group @ Berkeley</h4>
				<p>>> Built on top of haptix node, the audio-tactile backpack translates audio to haptic gestures along the spine -- allowing the user to feel music while they listen to it. A spectrum analyzer module containing 7 bandpass filters measures the amplitude of a real-time audio signal at 63Hz, 160Hz, 400Hz, 1kHz, 2.5kHz, 6.25kHz, and 16kHz, respectively. A Teensy microcontroller takes these amplitudes and maps them to the strength of 7 independent vibration motors arranged linearly along the backpack. As a result the user feels bass towards the tailbone, treble towards the neck, and everything in between, in between. The backpack is very fun to wear while coding.</p>

				<h3>[2014] Haptix Node</h3>
				<h4>Tencent Summer Innovation Program</h4>
				<p>>> Haptix Node is a hardware platform allowing developers to create inexpensive, miniaturized, wearable haptic feedback devices for augmented reality. With minimal effort and technical knowledge, users can map sensor data to customizable haptic gestures across an array of vibration motors worn on the body, allowing them to translate any measurable qualities of light, sound, force, etc. into sensations of touch.</p>

				<h3>[2014] Laser Harp ++</h3>
				<h4>Lucidity Festival</h4>
				<p>>> Designed, built, and programmed a 10' x 7', 16-channel laser harp functioning as a step sequencer and modular synthesizer. By intercepting any combination of lasers, unique musical sequences were generated and spatialized through a circular array of speakers using 4D surround sound technology developed by String Theory Labs. Sixteen knobs arranged around the instrument were then used to apply audio filters and effects to the generated sequence. The instrument was installed in a 30' geodesic dome built by Liminal Spaces Project at Lucidity Festival.</p>

				<h3>[2013] Route 101</h3>
				<h4>Personal Project</h4>
				<p>>> Wrote a simple program with Max and Jitter that performed mathematical operations on combinations of projected video. New operations/combinations of video were triggered every time I smashed my foot on a USB keyboard. I used this program to accompany a guitar performance at one of Lothlorien Co-op's Music + Story Nights.</p>

				<h3>[2013] Laser Harp</h3>
				<h4>Multimedia Orchestra @ Berkeley</h4>
				<p>>> Built an optical harp into an old backgammon briefcase, using arduino, lasers, photocells, and a whole mess of potentiometers, switches, and buttons. In 2013, I interfaced the harp with Max, Jitter, and Ableton, using it to perform sample-based electronic music and perform mathematical operations to projected video. Specifically, I used the instrument to narrate a russian animation with improvised music using only samples of compositions by Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky, and Shostakovich, and an 808 kick sample. English and Russian captions were displayed syllable-by-syllable with every triggered sample, and new mathematical operations were applied to the video when a new set of samples were uploaded to the instrument. In 2014, I performed the instrument at Maker Faire Bay Area, using it as a step sequencer and modular synthesizer.</p>

				<h3>[2013] Chemical Laptop</h3>
				<h4>Advanced Microfabrication + Optoelectronics Group - NASA, Jet Propulsion Laboratory</h4>
				<p>>> Worked to prepare the Chemical Laptop -- a portable, microfluidic microdevice used to detect molecular signatures of life in liquid samples -- for completely automated, end-to-end field analyses.  I revised the instrument's existing software to reduce the complexity of spectral data, optimize automated sample processing cycles, and developed new software and protocols enabling automated, colorimetric determination and adjustment of sample pH. On the hardware side, I explored a variety of fabrication methods, materials, and post-fabrication procedures to develop a lightweight, air-tight, pneumatic manifold resistant to deformation under high pressure.</p>

				<h3>[2011] Computing the Redox Potential of Organic Molecules on the Basis of Correlation to Experiment</h3>
				<h4>Organic Photochemistry Laboratory - Hope College</h4>
				<p>>> Used Gaussian09 / WebMO molecular modeling software to (1) test and expand a correlation between the redox potential and computed D0 - S0 energy difference of a set of organic compounds, (2) further develop a procedure for predicting the redox potential of our laboratory's synthesized photochromes using this correlation, and (3) determine future synthetic targets based on these predictions.</p>
