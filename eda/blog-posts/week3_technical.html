			<h2>Javascript: an Overview</h2>
			<p>Javascript is a widely-used scripting language for the web. Client-side JS supplies objects to make websites dynamic and responsive -- so that user events, like clicks, form input, etc., can alter the site's HTML and CSS. Server-side JS supplies objects that allow programs to be executed on a server.<br><br>
			In this post, I'll be going over to the best of my ability, the features of javascript, it's popularity, it's benefits and limitations, and so on.
			<h3>Advantages</h3>
			<p>JS is compatible with all devices and browsers, so anything you build with it will always render. JS can be run on the client-side and the server-side. There are great JS frameworks for front-end development, like Ember.JS, Angular.JS, and Backbone.js, as well as back-end development frameworks, like node.js, and engine.io. Recently, companies like Tessel and Espruino have used JS to program and operate embedded devices.<br><br>

			JS is relatively easy language to learn. Variable types are determined by their value -- all variables are declared with the universal type "var".
			For example, you could declare: "var x = 10", and JS would understand that x is an integer. Later on though, you could redeclare: "x = 'meow'", and JS would understand that x is now a string. JS is almost entirely object-based, and supports most object-oriented concepts as well as inheritance. Also, JS is a functional programming language. Functions can also be assigned to variables, and can accept functions as parameters. Functions can also be returned by a function.<br><br>

			JS is fast. It's executed on the client-side, meaning that the code is executed on the user's processor instead of the web server. This saves bandwidth and reduces strain on the web server. Also, since code is executed on the user's machine, processing is completed near instantaneously. Typically, code would be processed on the site's web server, and sent back the user. This ends up consuming local + server bandwidth. JS subverts this.</p>

			<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
			<p>There are some security issues with JS. Namely, JS snippets appended to a web page execute immediately and can thus be used to exploit the user's system. Certain restriction are set by modern browsers, though malicious code can still be executed within this restrictions.<br><br>

			Another disadvantage is that JS rendering can vary. Different layout engines can render JS inconsistently in terms of functionality and interface. Recent versions of JS have been written toward a universal standard; however, variations still exist.</p>
