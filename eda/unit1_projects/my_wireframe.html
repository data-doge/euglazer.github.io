	<h1>Website Redesign</h1>

		<h2>Plans + Sketches</h2>

		<p>I've learned a bit more about html/css standards, responsive design, and UX since the first version of my site. Here, I'll be redesigning my site using what I've since learned.<br><br>

		<img src="./images/index-wf-large.png" id="wf-large">
		<p>My website should be very simple. There are only two important things to present: myself, and my work. As such, I've divided my site into two parts: an about section, and a projects section.<br><br>

		At the very top is my name. In the about section, I'll have an image of myself, and a brief bio. In the projects section, I'll have all my projects housed in little containers. Each project container will have the title, a link to the website, and a link to the source code on github.<br><br>

		The only UX changes I think I need to make are making the line-height of the bio section larger, so that's it's easier to read.</p>

		<img src="./images/index-wf-small.png" id="wf-small">

		<p>Since my site is so simple, it will be very easy to make it responsive. I'll set a max-width on the body and leave the width of most of my elements unformatted, so that everything sort of wraps around neatly when the screen is made smaller.<br><br>

		More detail: in the about section, I'll have the image float left, with a margin on the right, so that the text wraps around the image when the screen is smaller.<br><br>

		In the Projects section, I'll have the project containers and their content float left, so that everything adapts fluidly when the screen size changes.</p>
